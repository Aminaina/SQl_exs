# HOW TO COUNT MEDIAN 
#EXCERCISE FROM HACKERRANK 
#A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half.
#Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.
#SOLUTION
WITH CTE AS (SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N ASC) RN_ASC,
 ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N DESC) RN_DESC
 FROM STATION) 
SELECT CONVERT(DECIMAL(16,4),AVG(LAT_N),4 )
FROM CTE
WHERE ABS(RN_ASC - RN_DESC )<=1
